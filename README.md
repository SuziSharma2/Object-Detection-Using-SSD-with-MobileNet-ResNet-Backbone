# Object-Detection-Using-SSD-with-MobileNet-ResNet-Backbone
This project implements an object detection system using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD300) architecture with a VGG16 backbone. The model is trained and evaluated on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. The goal is to detect and localize multiple objects in real-time from a single image.
